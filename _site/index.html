            The Privacy Paradox returns: Can government digital ID ever win public trust?
          </a>
        </h3><p>As all aspects of life have become increasingly digital, governments—and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-regulation">European Union</a>—have introduced digital identity schemes. These schemes replace physical ID cards with secure digital credentials (a login, app or digital wallet). Moreover, they often also support government verification of other claims (such as verifying your right to drive a vehicle without a physical driving license).</p>

            UK Government tests frictionless trade models with Ecosystem of Trust pilots

        </h3><p>The UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ecosystem-of-trust-evaluation-report-2023">Ecosystem of Trust</a> is a potential future border model for frictionless trade, which the UK government committed to pilot testing from October 2022 to March 2023.</p>

            Building an Ecosystem of Trust
          </a>
        </h3><p>Many people are familiar with the concept of self-assessment when it comes to income tax returns. Can the same principle be applied to traders when it comes to Customs and other border checks? A new ‘Ecosystem of Trust’ pilot at the Port of Felixstowe will demonstrate what can be achieved.</p>

            Did you pack this bag yourself?
          </a>
        </h3><p>“Did you pack this bag yourself?” It’s a question many of us are used to being asked when checking in at an airport. For a shipping container, the situation is more complex. Most organizations never communicate directly with the party that stuffed the container. Underpinned by blockchain technology, the TradeLens platform lays the foundation for global, digital supply chains. It connects all parties in the supply chain to drive true information sharing, foster collaboration and trust, and spur industry-wide innovation. Governments who embrace the opportunities offered by TradeLens place themselves in an ideal position to contribute positively towards a new era of global trade that is both frictionless and compliant.</p>

            Cognitive computing for Customs agencies: improving compliance and facilitation with better decisions
          </a>
        </h3><p>Data analytics – for example, automated selectivity rules – has become an increasingly important tool for Customs agencies. However, conventional data analytics has some critical limitations. It can only look for pre-defined patterns and rules, and cannot make use of unstructured data, which comes in the form of emails, social media, blogs, documents, images and videos. Cognitive computing allows Customs agencies to extract insights from both structured and unstructured data, discover new patterns and rules, capture the experience of top performers, and improve the quality and consistency of decision-making.</p>

            What does a Solution Architect actually do?

        </h3><p>Over the last few years I’ve often found myself working in the role of Solution Architect on large IT enabled business change programmes. This is often perceived as a rather mysterious role and I’m frequently asked questions along the lines of “What does a Solution Architect actually do?”. This post gives an example of the kind of work I’ve done in this role in the recent past.</p>
